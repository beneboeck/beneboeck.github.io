About Me
======
I am a research assistant and doctoral candidate at the Chair of Signal Processing, Technical University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Wolfgang Utschick. Previously, I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and information technology in 2019, the B.Sc. degree in physics in 2020, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and information technology in 2022. 

Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning and signal processing as well as wireless communications. Currently, I am specifically interested in 
incorporating prior knowledge in the design of generative models to facilitate the learning and improve performance. This prior knowledge can be in form of underlying pre-known physics or structural properties such as sparsity.
