About Me
======
I am a research assistant and doctoral candidate at the Chair of Signal Processing, Technical University of Munich, under the supervision of Prof. Wolfgang Utschick. Previously, I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, I obtained the B.Sc. in Physics from the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich (LMU) in 2020.

Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in Statistical Machine Learning and Signal Processing as well as Wireless Communications. I am currently focusing on the following two topics from which one is very specific for Wireless Communications and the other targets general machine learning:


**Combining the Physics of Wireless Signals with Machine Learning for Physical Layer Applications**

The challenges of applying machine learning, particularly deep learning, in wireless communications are mainly due to the difficulty of acquiring clean training data, the vast amount of system configurations resulting in varying data representations, and the strict latency and computational constraints. In my research, I try to address these issues by leveraging model knowledge—especially the underlying laws of physics—for designing trainable models and algorithms. For more details, see, e.g., [our recent ICML25 paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/publication/physics_informed).


**Leveraging Domain-Specific Expert Knowledge for Designing and Tailoring Generative Models**

Probabilistic priors have been used as regularizers long before modern generative models have emerged. Traditionally, such priors were not trainable but encoded domain-specific expert knowledge about the data (e.g., sparsity). In contrast, modern generative models are generally not designed to incorporate this type of prior knowledge. In my research, I investigate how expert knowledge can be integrated into the design of generative models to facilitate learning and enhance performance across various applications. For more details, see, e.g., [our recent NeurIPS24 paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/publication/sbgm).
