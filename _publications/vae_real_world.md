This work utilizes a variational autoencoder for channel estimation and evaluates it on real-world measurements. The estimator is trained solely on noisy channel observations and parameterizes an approximation to the mean squared error-optimal estimator by learning observation-dependent conditional first and second moments. The proposed estimator significantly outperforms related state-of-the-art estimators on real-world measurements. We investigate the effect of pre-training with synthetic data and find that the proposed estimator exhibits comparable results to the related estimators if trained on synthetic data and evaluated on the measurement data. Furthermore, pre-training on synthetic data also helps to reduce the required measurement training dataset size.
