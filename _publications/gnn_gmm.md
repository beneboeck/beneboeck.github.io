This letter proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework for statistical precoder design that leverages model-based insights to compactly represent statistical knowledge, resulting in efficient, lightweight architectures. The framework also supports approximate statistical information in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems obtained through a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based limited feedback scheme in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low pilot overhead. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over baseline methods, including stochastic iterative algorithms and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based approaches, particularly in systems with low pilot overhead.
