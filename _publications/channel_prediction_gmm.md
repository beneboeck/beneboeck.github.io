In this work, we utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to capture the underlying probability density function (PDF) of the channel trajectories of moving mobile terminals (MTs) within the coverage area of a base station (BS) in an offline phase. We propose to leverage the same GMM for channel prediction in the online phase. Our proposed approach does not require signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-specific training and allows for parallelization. Numerical simulations for both synthetic and measured channel data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GMM-based channel predictor compared to state-of-the-art channel prediction methods.
